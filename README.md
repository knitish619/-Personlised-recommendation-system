# -Personlised-recommendation-system

In today's world, we are surrounded by a plethora of video content, ranging from movies
and TV shows to short-form videos and online tutorials. With so much content available, it can be
challenging to find the right videos that match our interests and preferences. This is where
personalized recommendation feeds for video come in handy.
A personalized recommendation feed for video is an algorithmic system that suggests
videos based on a user's past viewing behavior, search history, and other relevant data points. It
leverages machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior and provide tailored
recommendations, thereby improving the user experience and engagement.
Personalized video recommendation systems are designed to suggest videos to users based
on their preferences and interests. The system analyses the user's viewing history, interactions, and
other relevant factors to create a profile that is unique to each user. The profile is then used to
generate personalized recommendations that are relevant and interesting to the user.
One approach to building a personalized video recommendation system is to use a
combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. Content-based filtering
analyses the attributes of videos such as genre, language, and duration to identify similar videos.
Collaborative filtering analyses the viewing history of users and identifies patterns of viewing
behavior to suggest videos that other similar users have enjoyed.
